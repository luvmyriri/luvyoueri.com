            <h1>Happy Valentines!, my love, my dear, my eri.</h1>
            <p>Hello my eri! Happy Valentine's day my love, I might have gave you this e-letter much later than the Valentine's day itself so sorry if ganon na nga. These past few days were a bit tough lalo na sa schedules natin, thank you dear for always checking up on me, it fuelled me everyday.
                I watched tutorials every morning for this letter and thankfully it turned out to be good mwehehehe. Hindi ka masyado fan ng mga bagay na hindi mo makekeep personally pero I'm hoping na maa-appreciate mo tong e-letter and prepare ka na rin for the long messages ahead.
            <br>    
                Happy Valentine's dear! I'm actually thanking god na nabigyan ako ng chance na icelebrate itong araw na ito para sa'yo, na ikaw pa rin, na ikaw sana sa lahat. Sobrang dami kong gustong ipagpasalamat so I would love to express them in this letter nalang.
            <br>    
                Thank you ri, for your support and presence all throughout the past year, it's 2024 na beb heheheheh thank you for letting me be a part of your life hanggang sa mga oras na to. We've been through some things and I'm thankful and manghang mangha sa maturity mo all those times. Remember the first valentine's na cimelebrate ko with you? Still, napaka halaga and may sobrang laking place siya sa heart and mind ko. Now na meduo restricted tayo dahil sa mga schedules natin, gusto ko pa ring ipafeel sa'yo na may valentine's day.
